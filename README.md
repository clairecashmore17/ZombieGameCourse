# ZombieGameCourse
My zombie FPS project from the udemy unity course.
Still in the process of finishing the course, but so far I have developed a FPS who has animation for shooting, reloading, and traversing. I have incorporated the ability 
to pick up ammo and med kits after depleting health and rounds. The next step would be creating the environment and adding enemies as well as a way to inflict damage.
